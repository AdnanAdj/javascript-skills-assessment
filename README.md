# JavaScript Skills Assessment

This repository contains a series of JavaScript programming challenges designed to test your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts.

## Getting Started

You have two options to work on this assessment:

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

1. Click the green "Code" button above
2. Select "Open with Codespaces"
3. Click "New codespace"
4. Wait for the environment to set up (this takes about 2 minutes)
5. Start coding! The environment comes with everything pre-installed

### Option 2: Local Development

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Complete the functions in the `src/challenges.js` file
4. Run tests using `npm test` to check your solutions
5. Commit and push your changes

## Challenges

You will need to implement the following functions:

1. `reverseString(str)`: Reverse a given string
2. `isPalindrome(str)`: Check if a string is a palindrome
3. `calculateFactorial(n)`: Calculate the factorial of a number
4. `findMaxNumber(arr)`: Find the maximum number in an array
5. `filterEvenNumbers(arr)`: Filter out even numbers from an array

## Testing Your Code

- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Run tests for a specific function: `npm test -- -t functionName`
- Watch mode (tests run on file changes): `npm test -- --watch`

## Evaluation

Your code will be automatically tested when you push your changes. The tests will check:
- Correct implementation of all functions
- Edge cases handling
- Code style (using ESLint)

## Development Environment Features

When using GitHub Codespaces, you get:
- Pre-configured JavaScript development environment
- VS Code with helpful extensions installed
- Automatic code formatting on save
- ESLint for code quality checking
- Jest test runner integration

Good luck!
